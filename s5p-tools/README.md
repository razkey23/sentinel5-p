S5P-Tools
=====================================

Scripts to download and process air-pollution data collected by the satellite [Sentinel-5P](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P) from the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu). The collect is based on the `sentinelsat` [package](https://github.com/sentinelsat/sentinelsat) and the [API Hub Access](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/twiki/do/view/SciHubWebPortal/APIHubDescription). L3 resampling is made with [HARP tools](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html).

## Installation

We recommend using `conda` to create and manage a virtual environment when using this set of scripts. You can create a new virtual environment with all dependencies pre-installed using
```
conda create --override-channels -c conda-forge -c stcorp --file requirements.txt --name <envname>
# sentinelsat is not available through conda so we install it using pip
conda activate <envname>
pip install sentinelsat
```
Alternatively, to install all dependencies in an already-existing environment, use
```
conda install --override-channels -c conda-forge -c stcorp --file requirements.txt
pip install sentinelsat
```

> **Notes:** `conda` can take a while to resolve dependencies.

## Downloading and processing data

### Quick start

The script `s5p-request.py` is used to query Copernicus Hub, download and process the data. The syntax is the following:

```bash
python s5p-request.py <product-type>
```
where `<product-type>` is a Sentinel-5P product. TROPOMI Level 2 geophysical products are given in the table below.

| Product type | Parameter                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L2__O3____   | Ozone (O3) total column                                           |
| L2__NO2___   | Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), tropospheric, stratospheric, slant column |
| L2__SO2___   | Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) total column                                 |
| L2__CO____   | Carbon Monoxide (CO) total column                                 |
| L2__CH4___   | Methane (CH4) total column                                        |
| L2__HCHO__   | Formaldehyde (HCHO) tropospheric, slant column                    |
| L2__AER_AI   | UV Aerosol Index                                                  |
| L2__CLOUD_   | Cloud fraction, albedo, top pressure                              |

By default, the script downloads all products corresponding to the specified product type for the last 24 hours. Custom date query can be specified with `--date`.

The resulting file is a `netCDF` file in the `processed` folder, binned by time, latitude, longitude, aligned on the same regular grid with resolution 0.01 x 0.01 arc degree by default. For parsing and plotting, we recommend the Python package `xarray`. An example of preliminary analysis can be found in the repo [s5p-analysis](https://github.com/bilelomrani1/s5p-analysis).

### Options

The script `python s5p-request.py` supports the following optional arguments:


| Option          | Description                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--date`        | Date used to perform a time interval search   |
| `--aoi`         | Path to the area of interest file (.geojson)  |
| `--unit`        | Unit conversion                               |
| `--qa`          | Quality assurance value threshold             |
| `--resolution`  | L3 grid spatial resolution in arc degrees     |
| `--num-threads` | Number of threads spawned for L2 download     |
| `--num-workers` | Number of processes spawned for L3 conversion |


#### Date

The `--date` option allows to perform a time interval search.

```bash
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --date <timestamp> <timestamp>
```
`<timestamp>` can be expressed in one of the following formats:
  - `yyyyMMdd`
  - `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ`
  - `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ`(ISO8601 format)
  - `NOW`
  - `NOW-<n>MINUTE(S)`
  - `NOW-<n>HOUR(S)`
  - `NOW-<n>DAY(S)`
  - `NOW-<n>MONTH(S)`

The first timestamp is included and the second is excluded.

#### Area of interest

The `--aoi` option allows to specify a custom geographical area with a `geojson` file.

```bash
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --aoi <geojson-file-url>
```
You can use [geoJSON.io](http://geojson.io) to generate a custom `.geojson` file for your area of interest.

#### Unit conversion

By default, no unit conversion is performed (SI units). To perform unit conversion, use `--unit`.

```bash
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --unit <unit>
```

Unit conversion supports the following arguments for densities:
- `Pmolec/cm2` (Ã—10^15 molecules per square centimeter)
- `molec/m2`
- `mol/m2` (default)

#### Quality value filtering

By default, the script filters all values whose quality assurance value is below 50. This behavior can be adjusted with `--qa`.

```bash
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --qa <int>
```

#### Spatial resolution

By default, the script uses a 0.01x0.01 arc degrees resolution grid during the L3 conversion (this corresponds to a resolution of approximately 1100x1100m, see [Approximate Metric Equivalents for Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds](https://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/md_help/html/approx_equivalents.htm)). This resolution can be adjusted with `--resolution`.

```bash
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --resolution <float> <float>
```

#### Number of threads

By default, the script spawns 4 threads when downloading from SentinelHub. This number can be adjusted with `--num-threads`.

```
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --num-threads <int>
```

#### Number of workers

By default, the script spawns a number of processes equals to the number of virtual cores when performing L3 conversion. This number can be adjusted with `--num-workers`.

```
python s5p-request.py <product-type> --num-workers <int>
```

## Compressing the data

### Quick start

The script `s5p-compress.py` is used to compress a processed netCDF file into multiple compressed `tif` files. The syntax is the following:

```bash
python s5p-compress.py <netcdf-file> <band-name>
```
where `<netcdf-file>` is a processed netCDF file created by `s5p-request.py` and `band-name` is the name of the variable to export.

### Options

| Option              | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--time-resolution` | Resampling rate of the time dimension           |
| `--shp`             | Path to the shapefile for masking (.shp)        |
| `--agg-func`        | Aggregation function after resampling           |
| `--num-workers`     | Number of processes spawned for tif compression |

#### Resampling the time dimension

By default, the sampling rate of the time dimension is set to `1D` so that the scripts export one file per day. Use the option `--time-resolution <n><frequency>` to adjust this behavior. The available date frequencies can be found below:

| Frequency String | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `W`              | Week        |
| `M`              | Month       |
| `A`              | Year        |
| `D`              | Day         |

#### Masking with a shapefile

The `--shp` option allows to mask the resulting compressed files with the geometry contained in a `.shp` shapefile.

```bash
python s5p-compress.py <netcdf-file> <band-name> --shp <shapefile-file-url>
```
If the shapefile contains more than one geometry, the script considers the union of all geometries.

#### Aggregation function after resampling

By default, the script uses `--agg-func mean` which corresponds to taking the mean after the resampling operation. The following aggregation functions can be used in place of `--agg-func mean`.

- `mean`
- `median`
- `sum`
- `std`
- `max`
- `min`

## Aggregation

### Quick start

The script `s5p-aggregate.py` exports a shapefile with a colum n containing aggregated data extracted from an input raster file. The syntax is the following:

```bash
python s5p-aggregate.py <raster-url> <shapefile-url>
```

### Options

#### Column name

You can adjust the name given to the column with `--col-name`.

#### Aggregation function

By default, the script uses `--agg-func mean` which corresponds to taking the mean of the raster on each geometry contained in the shapefile. The following aggregation functions can be used in place of `--agg-func mean`.

- `mean`
- `median`
- `sum`
- `std`
- `max`
- `min`
